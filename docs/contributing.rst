*This document contains information related to developing the Druzhba
application, specifically how to run unit and integration tests and the release
procedure for publishing a new version of Druzha. It will be of minimal use to
the average end user.*

Pull Requests
-------------

Unsolicited pull requests may be submitted against the ``master`` branch. Please
run Isort and Black (See: ``.pre-commit.sh`` for commands or better yet copy the
file to ``.git/hooks/pre-commit.sh`` to run them automatically) prior to opening
your pull request and ensure that unit tests pass. Maintainers will run the
integration test suite if appropriate.

Needed Features
---------------

This is a list of most requested Druzhba features:

- Complete SQL Server support (currently partial support)

- Support for multiple output database types

- Unrecognized table names in supplied via the ``--tables`` argument should be
  surfaced as a warning or error

- Add basic transformation support from YAML config like renaming columns or
  concatenating multiple columns etc. without requiring a full custom SQL table.

- The table extract functionality is tied unnecessarily to the name of the
  table in the source database, with a fake source table name supplied for
  manual queries. This prevents one source table from being copied to multiple
  destination tables with, for example, different subsets of columns.

- On the first run of a new source table, Druzhba should create the destination
  table even if the query against the source table returned no rows. The current
  behavior should be considered a bug.


Testing
-------

Unit Tests
^^^^^^^^^^

To run unit tests locally:

.. code-block:: bash

  python setup.py test

To use Docker for testing, create a `.env.test` file based on `env.test.sample`
with any environment variable overrides you wish to assign (can be empty).

To run unit tests in Docker:

.. code-block:: bash

  docker-compose run test


Integration Tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To run integration tests of full pipelines in Docker, you'll need to add
Redshift credentials to your environment or your `.env.test` file. This makes
use of a test schema in an existing Redshift database, and for safety will fail
if the schema name already exists.

Then run:

.. code-block:: bash

  source .env.test.sample
  source .env.test  # For whatever overrides you need

  docker-compose up -d postgres mysql
  docker-compose build test

  docker-compose run test bash test/integration/run_test.sh mysql postgres
